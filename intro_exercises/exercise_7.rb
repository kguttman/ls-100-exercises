# My first attempt (which I realized was incorrect):
# The major difference between an Array and a Hash is that 
# an Array uses integers as keys, so the data is in a specific 
# order. A Hash can have any data type for its keys, so the data 
# is not in a specific order.

# OKAY, NOW THAT I'VE READ THE SOLUTION IN THE EXERCISE, I REALIZE THE ABOVE IS 
# INCORRECT! An array's integer indexes are not considered "keys". 
# A Hash contains "key-value pairs" -- each value is associated with 
# a key. An Array is a sequence of elements, and each element can be 
# accessed by its index, beginning with 0. 


# Note the solution in the exercise is: "The major difference 
# between an array and a hash is that a hash contains a key value 
# pair for referencing by key."

# Exception handling means processing errors that occur as our 
# program is running. By processing the errors, we prevent our 
# program from stopping execution the moment an error is thrown.

# From the exercise: "Exception handling is a structure used to 
# handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It 
# is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control 
# without exiting the program entirely."
